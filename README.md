# Probability-Calculator
Solution to the freecodecamp exercise Probabiltiy Calculator, the code is somewhat commented, should be easy enough to follow.

Theres a commented additional draw method in hat class. It works fine and functions correctly for the prob_calculator function and i think using the sample method from random is easier. However the exercise says that it is neccesary that you remove the elements from contents.
